# birthday-reminder
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks.

This is my version of the Birthday Reminder project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo), made under the method of "Watch and then Do". 

### Overview and learnings
Birthday Reminder is a simple app that stores a list of friends and displays how many of their birthdays are at the current date.

The main React functionality I learned is how to dynamically add components and then how to remove them.
I made my own setup, styling and added some extra features to the original idea of the project.
